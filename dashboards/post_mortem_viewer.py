Below is a Python script that simulates a strategy game where strategies can undergo death, contradiction, or alpha collapse. The script will analyze and report the status after any of these events occur. The example provided is abstract and can be adapted to specific strategy game rules or scenarios.

```python
import random

class Strategy:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.alive = True
        self.strength = random.randint(1, 100)

    def report_status(self):
        if self.alive:
            print(f"Strategy {self.name} is alive with strength {self.strength}.")
        else:
            print(f"Strategy {self.name} has collapsed.")

def death(strategy):
    strategy.alive = False
    strategy.strength = 0
    print(f"Strategy {strategy.name} has died.")

def contradiction(strategy):
    if strategy.alive:
        loss = random.randint(10, 50)
        strategy.strength -= loss
        print(f"Strategy {strategy.name} faced a contradiction, losing {loss} strength.")
        if strategy.strength <= 0:
            death(strategy)

def alpha_collapse(strategy):
    if strategy.alive:
        strategy.strength = 0
        strategy.alive = False
        print(f"Strategy {strategy.name} has undergone an alpha collapse.")

def simulate_strategies():
    strategies = [Strategy(f"Strategy {i}") for i in range(5)]

    # Random events
    events = [death, contradiction, alpha_collapse]
    for _ in range(10):  # Simulate 10 rounds
        event = random.choice(events)
        target = random.choice(strategies)
        event(target)
        for strategy in strategies:
            strategy.report_status()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_strategies()
```

### Explanation:
- **Strategy Class**: Represents a strategy with a name, alive status, and strength.
- **death()**: Kills the strategy, setting its strength to 0.
- **contradiction()**: Reduces the strength of the strategy. If the strength falls below or equal to 0, the strategy dies.
- **alpha_collapse()**: Instantly kills the strategy by setting its strength to 0.
- **simulate_strategies()**: Creates a list of strategies and simulates random events (death, contradiction, alpha collapse) affecting them. After each event, the status of all strategies is reported.

This script can be expanded or modified to include more detailed strategy interactions, different types of events, and a more complex simulation environment.
