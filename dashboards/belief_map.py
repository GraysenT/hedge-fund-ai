Below is a Python code example that uses Matplotlib and NetworkX to visualize the evolution of internal belief structures over time. This example assumes a simple model where beliefs are represented as nodes in a graph, and the edges represent the relationships or influences between these beliefs. The evolution is simulated through changes in the graph structure over time.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np

def initialize_belief_graph(num_nodes=5):
    """ Initialize a simple belief graph with a given number of nodes. """
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        G.add_node(i, label=f'Belief {i}')
    return G

def evolve_graph(G, num_iterations=3):
    """ Simulate evolution of the graph by randomly adding and removing edges. """
    for _ in range(num_iterations):
        # Randomly add edges
        possible_edges = [(i, j) for i in G.nodes() for j in G.nodes() if i != j and not G.has_edge(i, j)]
        num_new_edges = np.random.randint(1, len(possible_edges) // 3 + 1)
        new_edges = np.random.choice(len(possible_edges), num_new_edges, replace=False)
        for edge in new_edges:
            G.add_edge(*possible_edges[edge])

        # Randomly remove edges
        existing_edges = list(G.edges())
        num_remove_edges = np.random.randint(0, len(existing_edges) // 3 + 1)
        remove_edges = np.random.choice(len(existing_edges), num_remove_edges, replace=False)
        for edge in remove_edges:
            G.remove_edge(*existing_edges[edge])

        yield G

def plot_graph(G, ax, title="Belief Graph"):
    """ Plot the graph on the given Matplotlib axis. """
    pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)  # For consistent layout
    nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_color='skyblue', node_size=2000, ax=ax, arrows=True)
    ax.set_title(title)

def main():
    num_nodes = 5
    num_iterations = 4

    G = initialize_belief_graph(num_nodes)
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, num_iterations + 1, figsize=(15, 3))

    # Plot initial state
    plot_graph(G, axes[0], "Initial Belief Graph")

    # Evolve and plot graph
    for i, G in enumerate(evolve_graph(G, num_iterations), start=1):
        plot_graph(G, axes[i], f"Step {i}")

    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The graph is initialized with a specified number of nodes, each representing a belief.
2. **Evolution**: The graph evolves by randomly adding and removing edges. Each edge represents a relationship or influence between two beliefs.
3. **Visualization**: The initial and each evolved state of the graph are plotted using Matplotlib and NetworkX.

This code provides a basic framework and can be extended or modified to include more complex belief dynamics and interactions.
