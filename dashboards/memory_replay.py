It seems like you're asking for a specific functionality that might relate to replaying or analyzing past strategies or decisions, possibly in a machine learning or AI context. Here's a Python example using a simple approach to store and replay past actions or decisions using a class structure. This example could be adapted for various applications, such as games, decision systems, or simulations:

```python
class StrategyMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = []

    def record_action(self, action, input_data, result):
        self.memory.append({
            'action': action,
            'input': input_data,
            'result': result
        })

    def replay_memory(self):
        for entry in self.memory:
            print(f"Action: {entry['action']}, Input: {entry['input']}, Result: {entry['result']}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    strategy_memory = StrategyMemory()

    # Simulating recording some strategies
    strategy_memory.record_action('Move', {'x': 10, 'y': 20}, 'Success')
    strategy_memory.record_action('Attack', {'target': 'Enemy1'}, 'Failed')
    strategy_memory.record_action('Defend', {'position': 'North'}, 'Success')

    # Replay all recorded strategies
    strategy_memory.replay_memory()
```

This code defines a `StrategyMemory` class that can store and replay actions along with their inputs and results. This is a basic framework and can be expanded with more complex data structures and functionalities depending on the requirements of your application.
