To create a visual heatmap of which feedback loops are most active and productive, we first need to define what constitutes a "feedback loop" and how we measure its activity and productivity. For this example, let's assume we have a dataset that represents different feedback loops in a system, their activity levels, and their productivity scores.

We will use Python with libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation and `seaborn` for creating the heatmap. Below is the Python code that generates a synthetic dataset and visualizes it using a heatmap.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a synthetic dataset
np.random.seed(0)
data = {
    'Feedback Loop': ['Loop A', 'Loop B', 'Loop C', 'Loop D', 'Loop E'],
    'Activity Level': np.random.randint(1, 100, 5),
    'Productivity Score': np.random.randint(1, 100, 5)
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Normalize the data columns to bring them to a comparable scale
df['Activity Level'] = (df['Activity Level'] - df['Activity Level'].min()) / (df['Activity Level'].max() - df['Activity Level'].min())
df['Productivity Score'] = (df['Productivity Score'] - df['Productivity Score'].min()) / (df['Productivity Score'].max() - df['Productivity Score'].min())

# Pivot the DataFrame to suit the heatmap format
heatmap_data = df.set_index('Feedback Loop').T

# Create the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.heatmap(heatmap_data, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=.5)
plt.title('Heatmap of Feedback Loop Activity and Productivity')
plt.show()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Creation**: We generate a synthetic dataset with random values for activity levels and productivity scores of different feedback loops.
2. **Normalization**: We normalize the 'Activity Level' and 'Productivity Score' columns to ensure they are on the same scale. This step is crucial for a fair comparison in the heatmap.
3. **Data Transformation**: We pivot the DataFrame to have feedback loops as rows and their attributes as columns, which fits the format required for a heatmap.
4. **Heatmap Generation**: We use `seaborn` to create the heatmap. The `annot=True` option adds numeric labels on each cell, providing a clearer view of the values.

This code will display a heatmap showing the relative activity and productivity of each feedback loop, helping to visually identify which loops are most active and productive. Adjust the dataset and parameters as needed based on your actual data and requirements.
