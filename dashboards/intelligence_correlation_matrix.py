Below is a Python script that simulates a basic model correlating intelligence growth with factors such as alpha (learning rate), recursion (depth of thought or iterative reflection), and stability (ability to maintain consistent growth without large fluctuations). This script uses a simple mathematical model to represent these relationships.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class IntelligenceGrowthModel:
    def __init__(self, initial_intelligence=0.1, alpha=0.05, recursion=1, stability=0.9, time_periods=100):
        self.intelligence = initial_intelligence
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.recursion = recursion
        self.stability = stability
        self.time_periods = time_periods
        self.history = []

    def update_intelligence(self):
        # Recursive intelligence growth influenced by alpha and recursion level
        growth_factor = self.alpha * np.power(self.intelligence, 1 / self.recursion)
        # Stability factor adjusts the growth to avoid large fluctuations
        stable_growth = self.stability * growth_factor + (1 - self.stability) * np.random.normal(0, 0.01)
        self.intelligence += stable_growth
        self.intelligence = max(self.intelligence, 0)  # Ensure intelligence doesn't go negative

    def simulate_growth(self):
        for _ in range(self.time_periods):
            self.update_intelligence()
            self.history.append(self.intelligence)

    def plot_growth(self):
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
        plt.plot(self.history, label=f'Alpha: {self.alpha}, Recursion: {self.recursion}, Stability: {self.stability}')
        plt.xlabel('Time Periods')
        plt.ylabel('Intelligence')
        plt.title('Intelligence Growth Over Time')
        plt.legend()
        plt.grid(True)
        plt.show()

# Example usage
model = IntelligenceGrowthModel(alpha=0.1, recursion=2, stability=0.95, time_periods=200)
model.simulate_growth()
model.plot_growth()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The model starts with an initial intelligence level, learning rate (alpha), recursion depth, stability factor, and number of time periods to simulate.
2. **Update Mechanism**: Each period, the intelligence is updated based on the current intelligence, modified by the learning rate and adjusted for recursion. Stability is introduced to dampen the growth fluctuations, incorporating some randomness to simulate external influences or internal inconsistencies.
3. **Simulation**: The model runs for a specified number of periods, updating and recording the intelligence level at each step.
4. **Visualization**: Finally, the growth of intelligence over time is plotted.

This script can be modified to explore how different values of alpha, recursion, and stability affect the growth of intelligence.
