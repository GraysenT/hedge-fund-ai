Below is a Python script that uses a simple machine learning model to predict how mission statements might evolve based on internal feedback. The script uses a basic form of natural language processing and sentiment analysis to understand the feedback and suggest changes to the mission statement accordingly.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from textblob import TextBlob

# Sample data: feedback and corresponding mission statement changes
data = {
    'Feedback': [
        "We need to focus more on sustainability and green practices.",
        "Our mission should reflect more on innovation in technology.",
        "We should include community support and engagement in our mission.",
        "It's important to emphasize employee welfare in our mission statement.",
        "Customer satisfaction should be at the forefront of our mission."
    ],
    'Mission Change': [
        "Commit to sustainable and environmentally friendly practices.",
        "Drive innovation and technological advancement.",
        "Engage and support our community in every activity.",
        "Prioritize the welfare and development of our employees.",
        "Ensure customer satisfaction and build lasting relationships."
    ]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Vectorize the text data and create a model pipeline
model = make_pipeline(CountVectorizer(), MultinomialNB())

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df['Feedback'], df['Mission Change'], test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Function to predict changes in the mission statement based on new feedback
def predict_mission_change(new_feedback):
    prediction = model.predict([new_feedback])[0]
    feedback_sentiment = TextBlob(new_feedback).sentiment
    print(f"Feedback Sentiment: Polarity={feedback_sentiment.polarity}, Subjectivity={feedback_sentiment.subjectivity}")
    return prediction

# Example usage
new_feedback = "We should be leaders in digital innovation and user experience."
predicted_change = predict_mission_change(new_feedback)
print("Suggested Mission Statement Change:", predicted_change)
```

This script uses a Naive Bayes classifier trained on a small dataset of feedback and corresponding mission statement changes. It also analyzes the sentiment of the feedback to provide additional insights. For real-world applications, you would need a much larger and more diverse dataset to train the model effectively.
