Below is a Python script that simulates and visualizes a system's upgrade and intelligence evolution steps using Matplotlib for visualization. This script will create a simple bar chart that updates to show the progress of system upgrades and intelligence improvements over time.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import time

def simulate_system_upgrades(num_steps=10, upgrade_impact=0.1):
    """
    Simulates system upgrades and intelligence evolution.
    
    Args:
    num_steps (int): Number of upgrade steps.
    upgrade_impact (float): Impact of each upgrade on system intelligence.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of intelligence levels at each step.
    """
    intelligence_levels = [0.5]  # Starting intelligence level
    for i in range(1, num_steps):
        new_level = intelligence_levels[-1] + upgrade_impact
        intelligence_levels.append(new_level)
    return intelligence_levels

def visualize_upgrades(intelligence_levels):
    """
    Visualizes the upgrades using a bar chart.
    
    Args:
    intelligence_levels (list): List of intelligence levels at each upgrade step.
    """
    num_steps = len(intelligence_levels)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    barlist = plt.bar(range(num_steps), intelligence_levels, color='blue')
    
    plt.xlabel('Upgrade Step')
    plt.ylabel('Intelligence Level')
    plt.title('System Intelligence Evolution')
    plt.ylim(0, max(intelligence_levels) + 0.5)
    
    for i in range(num_steps):
        plt.pause(0.5)  # Pause for half a second to visualize the update
        if i < num_steps - 1:
            barlist[i].set_color('c')  # Change color after updating
        plt.draw()
    
    plt.show()

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_steps = 10
    upgrade_impact = 0.1
    intelligence_levels = simulate_system_upgrades(num_steps, upgrade_impact)
    visualize_upgrades(intelligence_levels)
```

This script defines two functions:
1. `simulate_system_upgrades`: Simulates the system upgrades by incrementally increasing an intelligence level.
2. `visualize_upgrades`: Uses Matplotlib to create a dynamic bar chart that updates to reflect each step in the system's intelligence evolution.

When you run this script, it will display a bar chart that updates every half second to show the progress of the system's intelligence as it is upgraded over time. Adjust `num_steps` and `upgrade_impact` to simulate different scenarios.
