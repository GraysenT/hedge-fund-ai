Below is a Python code example that simulates a system performing tasks over multiple cycles, scoring itself after each cycle based on the success of a task. The system uses a simple scoring mechanism to evaluate its performance after each major decision or cycle.

```python
import random

class System:
    def __init__(self):
        self.score = 0
        self.history = []

    def perform_task(self):
        """Simulate performing a task that has a random chance of success."""
        # Randomly decide if the task is successful (70% chance of success)
        return random.random() < 0.7

    def update_score(self, success):
        """Update the system's score based on the task's success."""
        if success:
            self.score += 10  # Increment score by 10 for a successful task
        else:
            self.score -= 5   # Decrement score by 5 for a failed task

    def log_history(self, cycle, success):
        """Log the result of each cycle."""
        self.history.append((cycle, 'Success' if success else 'Failure', self.score))

    def run_cycles(self, num_cycles):
        """Run the system for a specified number of cycles."""
        for cycle in range(1, num_cycles + 1):
            success = self.perform_task()
            self.update_score(success)
            self.log_history(cycle, success)

    def print_history(self):
        """Print the history of all cycles."""
        for entry in self.history:
            print(f"Cycle {entry[0]}: {entry[1]}, Score: {entry[2]}")

# Example usage
system = System()
system.run_cycles(5)
system.print_history()
```

This code defines a `System` class that can perform tasks, update its score based on the outcome of those tasks, and log the history of its performance. The `perform_task` method simulates a task with a 70% chance of success. The `update_score` method adjusts the system's score based on whether the task was successful. The `log_history` method records the outcome and current score after each cycle. Finally, the `print_history` method outputs the results of all cycles.

You can run this code to see how the system scores itself after each cycle, reflecting on its decisions and outcomes. Adjust the probability in `perform_task` or the scoring in `update_score` to simulate different scenarios.
