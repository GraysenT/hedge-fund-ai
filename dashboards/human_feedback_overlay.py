Below is a Python code example that creates a simple web application using Flask. This application allows users to vote on or rate a piece of logic (a statement or decision) post-hoc. The application uses an in-memory structure to store votes, making it suitable for demonstration purposes. For a production environment, you would typically use a database.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

# In-memory storage for logic statements and ratings
logic_statements = {
    1: {"statement": "All humans should work remotely.", "votes": {"up": 0, "down": 0}},
    2: {"statement": "Artificial Intelligence will benefit humanity.", "votes": {"up": 0, "down": 0}}
}

# HTML template for displaying logic statements and voting interface
HTML_TEMPLATE = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Logic Voting System</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Vote on Logic Statements</h1>
    {% for id, logic in logic_statements.items() %}
        <div>
            <h2>{{ logic.statement }}</h2>
            <p>Upvotes: {{ logic.votes.up }}</p>
            <p>Downvotes: {{ logic.votes.down }}</p>
            <form action="/vote/{{ id }}/up" method="post">
                <input type="submit" value="Upvote">
            </form>
            <form action="/vote/{{ id }}/down" method="post">
                <input type="submit" value="Downvote">
            </form>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
</body>
</html>
"""

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template_string(HTML_TEMPLATE, logic_statements=logic_statements)

@app.route('/vote/<int:logic_id>/<string:vote_type>', methods=['POST'])
def vote(logic_id, vote_type):
    if logic_id in logic_statements and vote_type in ['up', 'down']:
        logic_statements[logic_id]['votes'][vote_type] += 1
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### How to Run the Code
1. Install Flask if you haven't already: `pip install flask`
2. Save the code to a file, for example, `app.py`.
3. Run the file: `python app.py`.
4. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the application in action.

### Explanation
- The application defines a set of logic statements each with a unique ID.
- Users can vote up or down on each statement.
- The Flask app handles displaying these statements and processing the votes.
- Votes are stored in a simple dictionary and are reset when the application restarts (since no database is used here).
