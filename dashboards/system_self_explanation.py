Here is a Python code example that demonstrates a simple decision-making process. The code includes comments that explain how and why each decision is made:

```python
def make_decision(input_value):
    # Explain the decision-making process
    print("Starting decision-making process.")

    # Check if the input value is a positive number
    if input_value > 0:
        decision = "Positive"
        reason = "The input value is greater than zero."
    # Check if the input value is a negative number
    elif input_value < 0:
        decision = "Negative"
        reason = "The input value is less than zero."
    # If the input value is neither positive nor negative, it must be zero
    else:
        decision = "Zero"
        reason = "The input value is equal to zero."

    # Output the decision and the reason behind it
    print(f"Decision: {decision}")
    print(f"Reason: {reason}")

# Example usage of the function
make_decision(10)
make_decision(-5)
make_decision(0)
```

This code defines a function `make_decision` that takes an `input_value` and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero. It prints out the decision along with the reasoning behind each decision. This helps in understanding the flow of decisions based on different inputs.
