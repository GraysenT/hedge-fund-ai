This Python code defines a class `GhostBehaviorRecorder` to record and track behaviors and decisions, particularly focusing on "ghost" or forgotten behaviors that still influence decisions. The class provides methods to add behaviors and decisions, retrieve descriptions of behaviors, and find decisions influenced by specific behaviors.
