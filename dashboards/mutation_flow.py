Below is a Python code that uses Matplotlib and NetworkX to visualize the flow and impact of recent strategy mutations. This example assumes you have a set of strategies and mutations between them, and you want to visualize how strategies evolve over time.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import networkx as nx

def visualize_strategy_mutations(mutations, impact_scores):
    """
    Visualizes the flow and impact of strategy mutations.

    :param mutations: List of tuples (from_strategy, to_strategy)
    :param impact_scores: Dictionary mapping strategy to its impact score
    """
    # Create a directed graph
    G = nx.DiGraph()

    # Add nodes and edges to the graph
    for from_strategy, to_strategy in mutations:
        G.add_edge(from_strategy, to_strategy)

    # Define node size based on impact scores
    node_sizes = [impact_scores[node] * 1000 for node in G.nodes()]

    # Define node color based on impact scores
    node_colors = [impact_scores[node] for node in G.nodes()]

    # Draw the graph
    pos = nx.spring_layout(G)  # positions for all nodes
    nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=node_sizes, node_color=node_colors, cmap=plt.cm.Blues,
            font_size=8, font_color='black', font_weight='bold', arrowstyle='-|>', arrowsize=10)

    # Draw node labels with impact scores
    node_labels = {node: f"{node}\n(Impact: {impact_scores[node]:.2f})" for node in G.nodes()}
    nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, labels=node_labels, font_size=8)

    # Show the plot
    plt.title('Strategy Mutations and Their Impact')
    plt.colorbar(plt.cm.ScalarMappable(cmap=plt.cm.Blues), label='Impact Score')
    plt.show()

# Example data
mutations = [
    ('Strategy1', 'Strategy2'),
    ('Strategy2', 'Strategy3'),
    ('Strategy1', 'Strategy3'),
    ('Strategy3', 'Strategy4')
]

impact_scores = {
    'Strategy1': 1.0,
    'Strategy2': 1.5,
    'Strategy3': 2.0,
    'Strategy4': 2.5
}

visualize_strategy_mutations(mutations, impact_scores)
```

This code defines a function `visualize_strategy_mutations` that takes a list of mutations (as tuples of from and to strategies) and a dictionary of impact scores for each strategy. It uses NetworkX to create and visualize a directed graph where nodes represent strategies, edges represent mutations, and node sizes and colors represent the impact scores of the strategies. Adjust the `impact_scores` values and `mutations` list according to your actual data.
