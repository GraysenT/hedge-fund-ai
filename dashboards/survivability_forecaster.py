To create a Python program that forecasts which modules or agents are likely to persist, we can use a machine learning approach. This example will use a simple dataset and logistic regression to predict the persistence of modules based on some features. We'll use `pandas` for data handling, `sklearn` for creating a logistic regression model, and `numpy` for numerical operations.

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

Here's the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Example data: features might include metrics like usage frequency, error rate, user ratings, etc.
# 'persist' is the target variable (1 for likely to persist, 0 for not)
data = {
    'usage_frequency': [10, 20, 5, 30, 15, 7, 25, 18, 9, 14],
    'error_rate': [1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 3],
    'user_rating': [4.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.8, 3.5, 3.2, 4.9, 4.2, 3.1, 3.8],
    'persist': [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
}

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Features and Target
X = df[['usage_frequency', 'error_rate', 'user_rating']]
y = df['persist']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Create a Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Predict whether a new module with given features will persist
new_module = np.array([[20, 2, 4.5]])  # Example new module features
prediction = model.predict(new_module)
print("New module will persist:" if prediction[0] == 1 else "New module will not persist")
```

This code snippet does the following:
1. Creates a sample dataset with features that might influence the persistence of a module.
2. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
3. Trains a logistic regression model on the training data.
4. Evaluates the model on the test data and prints the accuracy.
5. Predicts the persistence of a new module based on its features.

You can modify the dataset and features according to the specific characteristics of the modules or agents in your actual use case.
