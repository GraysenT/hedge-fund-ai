Below is a Python script that simulates a basic model of how beliefs shape logic, agents, and behaviors over time. This script uses a simple agent-based model where each agent has a set of beliefs, and these beliefs influence their logic and behaviors. The script will track how these elements evolve over time.

```python
import random

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, id, beliefs):
        self.id = id
        self.beliefs = beliefs
        self.behaviors = []

    def apply_logic(self):
        """ Apply logic based on beliefs to generate behavior """
        if 'cooperation' in self.beliefs:
            self.behaviors.append('cooperate')
        elif 'selfishness' in self.beliefs:
            self.behaviors.append('defect')
        else:
            self.behaviors.append('random')

    def update_beliefs(self, global_events):
        """ Update beliefs based on global events """
        if global_events == 'crisis':
            if 'cooperation' in self.beliefs:
                self.beliefs.remove('cooperation')
                self.beliefs.add('selfishness')
            elif 'selfishness' not in self.beliefs:
                self.beliefs.add('selfishness')

    def act(self):
        """ Determine the agent's action based on its behavior """
        current_behavior = self.behaviors[-1]
        if current_behavior == 'cooperate':
            return 'cooperating'
        elif current_behavior == 'defect':
            return 'defecting'
        else:
            return 'acting randomly'

def simulate_time_steps(num_agents, num_steps):
    agents = [Agent(i, random.choice([{'cooperation'}, {'selfishness'}, set()])) for i in range(num_agents)]
    global_events = ['peace', 'crisis', 'peace', 'crisis'] * (num_steps // 4)

    for step in range(num_steps):
        print(f"Time Step {step + 1}")
        current_event = global_events[step % len(global_events)]
        print(f"Global Event: {current_event}")

        for agent in agents:
            agent.update_beliefs(current_event)
            agent.apply_logic()
            action = agent.act()
            print(f"Agent {agent.id} with beliefs {agent.beliefs} acts by {action}")

        print("\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_time_steps(5, 10)
```

This script defines an `Agent` class with methods to apply logic based on beliefs, update beliefs based on global events, and act based on behaviors. The simulation runs for a specified number of time steps and agents, with agents reacting to a sequence of global events (like 'crisis' or 'peace'). Each agent's beliefs influence their logic, which in turn determines their behaviors and actions. The output shows how each agent's beliefs and actions evolve over time.
