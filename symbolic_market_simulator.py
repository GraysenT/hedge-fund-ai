Below is a Python code example that simulates interactions using symbolic assets like reputation, attention, and influence. This simulation models how these assets can impact the decisions and interactions among individuals in a simplified social network.

```python
import random

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.reputation = random.randint(1, 100)
        self.attention = random.randint(1, 100)
        self.influence = random.randint(1, 100)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name} (Rep: {self.reputation}, Att: {self.attention}, Inf: {self.influence})"

    def interact(self, other):
        # Influence exchange logic
        if self.influence > other.influence:
            self.reputation += 1
            other.reputation -= 1
        else:
            self.reputation -= 1
            other.reputation += 1

        # Attention exchange logic
        attention_shift = random.randint(0, 10)
        if self.attention > attention_shift:
            self.attention -= attention_shift
            other.attention += attention_shift
        else:
            other.attention -= attention_shift
            self.attention += attention_shift

        print(f"After interaction: {self} <-> {other}")

def simulate_interactions(people, num_interactions):
    for _ in range(num_interactions):
        person1, person2 = random.sample(people, 2)
        print(f"Before interaction: {person1} <-> {person2}")
        person1.interact(person2)

# Example usage
people = [Person("Alice"), Person("Bob"), Person("Charlie"), Person("Diana")]

simulate_interactions(people, 10)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Person Class**: Each person has a name and three symbolic assets: reputation, attention, and influence, initialized with random values.
2. **Interact Method**: Defines how two persons interact. The person with higher influence gains reputation, and the one with lower loses some. Attention is exchanged randomly.
3. **simulate_interactions Function**: Randomly selects pairs from a list of people and simulates interactions between them.

This code provides a basic framework and can be expanded with more complex rules and interactions to better simulate specific social dynamics.
