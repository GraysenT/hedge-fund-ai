Below is a Python script that monitors the performance of agents or modules and sends alerts when their performance deviates from expected thresholds. This example uses a simple simulation where the performance of each agent or module is randomly generated. Alerts are printed to the console, but this can be extended to send emails, SMS, or integrate with other alerting systems.

```python
import random
import time

def monitor_agents(agent_count=5, threshold=0.8, check_interval=5, duration=60):
    """
    Monitors the performance of specified number of agents.
    
    :param agent_count: Number of agents to monitor.
    :param threshold: Performance threshold. Alert if performance drops below this value.
    :param check_interval: Time in seconds between performance checks.
    :param duration: Total duration to run the monitoring in seconds.
    """
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Simulate initial performance
    agent_performance = {f'Agent_{i}': 1.0 for i in range(agent_count)}
    
    while time.time() - start_time < duration:
        for agent in agent_performance:
            # Simulate performance fluctuation
            performance = random.uniform(0.5, 1.0)
            agent_performance[agent] = performance
            
            # Check if performance is below threshold
            if performance < threshold:
                print(f"Alert: {agent} performance dropped below threshold: {performance:.2f}")
        
        # Wait for the next check
        time.sleep(check_interval)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    monitor_agents()
```

### Explanation:
- **monitor_agents function**: This function simulates monitoring of agents. It checks their performance at regular intervals and prints an alert if the performance falls below a specified threshold.
- **agent_count**: Number of agents to monitor.
- **threshold**: The minimum acceptable performance level. If an agent's performance drops below this level, an alert is triggered.
- **check_interval**: How often (in seconds) to check the performance of each agent.
- **duration**: How long (in seconds) the monitoring should continue.

### Extending the Functionality:
- **Email Notifications**: Integrate with an email service to send email alerts.
- **Logging**: Implement logging to keep records of performance data and alerts.
- **Data Source**: Replace the random performance simulation with real data from actual agents or modules.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a web dashboard to display real-time performance data and alerts.

This script provides a basic framework and can be expanded based on specific requirements and integration needs.
