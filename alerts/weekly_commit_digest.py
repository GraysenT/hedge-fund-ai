#Below is a Python script that simulates the functionality of tracking and reporting changes to modules over a week. This script will generate a report based on simulated data, as actual module tracking would require integration with a version control system like Git.

    {"module": "api", "change_type": "promoted", "date": datetime.date(2023, 12, 3)},
    {"module": "frontend", "change_type": "added", "date": datetime.date(2023, 12, 4)},

# Define the week for the report
today = datetime.date.today()
start_of_week = today - datetime.timedelta(days=today.weekday())  # Monday of this week
end_of_week = start_of_week + datetime.timedelta(days=6)  # Sunday of this week

# Generate the report
weekly_report = get_weekly_report(module_changes, start_of_week, end_of_week)

# Print the report
print("Weekly Module Changes Report:")
print("Added Modules:", ", ".join(weekly_report["added"]))
print("Changed Modules:", ", ".join(weekly_report["changed"]))
print("Promoted Modules:", ", ".join(weekly_report["promoted"]))

#This script:
#1. Defines a list of module changes with their type and date.
#2. Contains a function `get_weekly_report` that filters changes based on a specified date range.
#3. Calculates the start and end of the current week.
#4. Generates and prints a report based on the simulated data.

#For a real-world application, integration with a version control system or project management tool would be necessary to fetch actual data on module changes.
