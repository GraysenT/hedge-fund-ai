Here's a Python script that scans machine learning models (agents) for risks such as decay, drift, overfitting, or contradiction. This script uses synthetic data and simple models for demonstration purposes. It includes checks for data drift, model performance decay, overfitting, and logical contradictions in predictions.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification

def generate_data():
    X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=15, n_redundant=5, random_state=42)
    return X, y

def check_data_drift(original_data, new_data, threshold=0.1):
    original_means = np.mean(original_data, axis=0)
    new_means = np.mean(new_data, axis=0)
    drifts = np.abs((original_means - new_means) / original_means)
    features_drifted = np.sum(drifts > threshold)
    return features_drifted, drifts

def check_model_decay(initial_accuracy, new_accuracy, threshold=0.05):
    decay = initial_accuracy - new_accuracy
    return decay > threshold, decay

def check_overfitting(training_accuracy, validation_accuracy, threshold=0.05):
    overfit = training_accuracy - validation_accuracy
    return overfit > threshold, overfit

def check_contradictions(model, data, threshold=0.1):
    predictions = model.predict_proba(data)
    contradictions = np.sum(np.max(predictions, axis=1) < (1 - threshold))
    return contradictions, predictions

# Generate initial data
X, y = generate_data()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
initial_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, model.predict(X_test))

# Simulate new data (with slight changes)
X_new, y_new = generate_data()
X_new *= np.random.normal(1.0, 0.1, X_new.shape)  # Introduce slight drift
X_new_train, X_new_test, y_new_train, y_new_test = train_test_split(X_new, y_new, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Check for data drift
features_drifted, drifts = check_data_drift(X_train, X_new_train)
print(f"Features drifted: {features_drifted}")
print(f"Drift details per feature: {drifts}")

# Check for model decay
new_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_new_test, model.predict(X_new_test))
is_decay, decay = check_model_decay(initial_accuracy, new_accuracy)
print(f"Model decay: {is_decay}, Amount: {decay}")

# Check for overfitting
train_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_train, model.predict(X_train))
is_overfit, overfit = check_overfitting(train_accuracy, initial_accuracy)
print(f"Overfitting: {is_overfit}, Amount: {overfit}")

# Check for contradictions
contradictions, predictions = check_contradictions(model, X_new_test)
print(f"Contradictions found: {contradictions}")

# Re-train model on new data and check performance
model.fit(X_new_train, y_new_train)
new_train_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_new_train, model.predict(X_new_train))
new_test_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_new_test, model.predict(X_new_test))
print(f"New training accuracy: {new_train_accuracy}, New test accuracy: {new_test_accuracy}")
```

This script performs the following:
1. Generates synthetic data.
2. Trains a RandomForest model.
3. Simulates new data with slight changes to introduce data drift.
4. Checks for data drift by comparing feature means.
5. Checks for model performance decay by comparing accuracies on new test data.
6. Checks for overfitting by comparing training and test accuracies.
7. Checks for logical contradictions in model predictions.
8. Retrains the model on new data and evaluates performance to see if retraining helps.

You can adapt this script to work with real data and more complex models as needed.
