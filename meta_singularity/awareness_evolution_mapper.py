Below is a Python script that uses matplotlib to plot the awareness growth across internal generations. This example assumes a simple model where awareness grows exponentially with each generation. You can modify the growth function as per your specific requirements.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Parameters
num_generations = 10
initial_awareness = 10
growth_rate = 1.2  # Growth rate per generation

# Generate data
generations = np.arange(0, num_generations)
awareness = initial_awareness * growth_rate ** generations

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(generations, awareness, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='b')
plt.title('Awareness Growth Across Generations')
plt.xlabel('Generation')
plt.ylabel('Awareness')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

This script will create a plot showing how awareness increases from generation to generation based on the specified growth rate. Adjust `num_generations`, `initial_awareness`, and `growth_rate` to fit the scenario you are analyzing.
