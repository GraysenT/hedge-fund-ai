This Python code defines a `StagnationDetector` class that can be used to monitor a sequence of states (e.g., measurements, values) to detect when there has been little to no significant change over a specified number of past observations, indicating stagnation. The class uses a history buffer to keep track of the last few states and compares new states against these to determine if the system is stagnant based on a defined tolerance.
