Here's a Python code snippet that implements a basic continuity plan for a recursive function. This example monitors recursion depth and memory usage, and it gracefully exits or modifies behavior if certain thresholds are exceeded. This can be useful in scenarios where recursion might deeply nest and risk hitting the recursion limit or consuming excessive memory.

```python
import sys
import os
import resource
import functools

def monitor_resources(func):
    """
    Decorator to monitor memory usage and recursion depth.
    Adjusts behavior if thresholds are exceeded.
    """
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Check recursion depth
        current_depth = len(inspect.stack())
        if current_depth > sys.getrecursionlimit() - 10:  # Close to the limit
            print("Warning: Close to recursion limit.")
            return None  # or handle appropriately

        # Check memory usage
        usage = resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss
        if usage > 1000000:  # Example threshold in kilobytes
            print("Warning: Memory usage is high.")
            return None  # or handle appropriately

        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@monitor_resources
def recursive_function(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        return x + recursive_function(x - 1)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import inspect
    print(recursive_function(100))  # Adjust the number based on your system's capabilities
```

### Explanation:
1. **Decorator Function (`monitor_resources`)**: This function wraps another function to add additional behavior (monitoring in this case). It checks the current recursion depth against the system's recursion limit and monitors the memory usage. If any of these exceed predefined thresholds, it modifies the behavior by returning `None` or by handling the situation in another appropriate way.

2. **Recursive Function (`recursive_function`)**: This is a simple recursive function that sums numbers from `x` to `0`. It's decorated with `@monitor_resources`, so each call is monitored.

3. **Resource and Recursion Monitoring**:
   - **Recursion Depth**: It checks if the current recursion depth is close to the system's recursion limit (`sys.getrecursionlimit()`).
   - **Memory Usage**: It checks the current memory usage using `resource.getrusage(resource.RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss`, which returns the maximum resident set size used (in kilobytes).

This script is a basic framework and might need adjustments based on specific requirements, such as different thresholds or handling strategies.
