Here's a Python code snippet that measures the system's trust in itself at different recursion depths using a simple trust metric simulation. The trust metric decreases as the recursion depth increases, reflecting a decrease in trust with increasing complexity or depth of recursion.

```python
def trust_metric(depth, initial_trust=1.0, decay_factor=0.9):
    if depth == 0:
        return initial_trust
    else:
        current_trust = initial_trust * decay_factor
        return trust_metric(depth - 1, current_trust, decay_factor)

def main():
    max_depth = 10
    for depth in range(max_depth + 1):
        trust_level = trust_metric(depth)
        print(f"Recursion Depth {depth}: Trust Level = {trust_level:.4f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines a recursive function `trust_metric` that calculates the trust level at a given recursion depth. The trust level decreases by a factor (decay_factor) with each deeper level of recursion. The `main` function iterates through recursion depths from 0 to a specified maximum, printing the trust level at each depth.
