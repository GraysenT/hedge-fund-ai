To visualize belief networks across all agent layers and time scales, you can use Python libraries such as `networkx` for creating and manipulating the network structure and `matplotlib` for visualizing these networks. Below is a Python script that sets up a basic framework for creating a multi-layer belief network and visualizing it over different time scales.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def create_belief_network(layer, num_nodes=5):
    """Create a sample belief network for a given layer."""
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    for i in range(num_nodes):
        for j in range(i + 1, num_nodes):
            if np.random.rand() > 0.5:  # Randomly create edges
                G.add_edge(f"Layer{layer}_Node{i}", f"Layer{layer}_Node{j}")
    return G

def visualize_networks(networks, title="Belief Networks Across Layers and Time Scales"):
    """Visualize a list of networks."""
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=len(networks), ncols=len(networks[0]), figsize=(15, 10))
    for i, row in enumerate(networks):
        for j, net in enumerate(row):
            ax = axes[i, j] if len(networks) > 1 else axes[j]
            nx.draw(net, ax=ax, with_labels=True, node_color='skyblue', node_size=700, font_size=10, font_color='darkred')
            ax.set_title(f"Time {j+1}, Layer {i+1}")
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.suptitle(title, fontsize=16)
    plt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)
    plt.show()

def main():
    num_layers = 3
    num_time_steps = 4
    networks = [[create_belief_network(layer=i+1) for _ in range(num_time_steps)] for i in range(num_layers)]
    visualize_networks(networks)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function `create_belief_network`**: This function generates a directed graph for a given layer. Nodes represent beliefs, and edges represent dependencies between these beliefs. The connections are randomly generated for demonstration purposes.

2. **Function `visualize_networks`**: This function takes a 2D list of networks (layers by time steps) and visualizes them using `matplotlib`. Each subplot represents the network at a specific time step and layer.

3. **Function `main`**: This sets up the network for multiple layers and time steps, then calls the visualization function.

### Usage:
Run this script to generate and visualize a set of belief networks across different layers and time scales. You can adjust `num_layers` and `num_time_steps` to see how the network evolves over time and across different layers. This script is highly customizable depending on the specific details and complexity of the belief networks you are working with.
