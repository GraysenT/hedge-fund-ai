Here's a Python script that uses a simple machine learning model to predict the intent of a module based on its behavior. The script uses a decision tree classifier, which is a basic yet effective model for classification tasks. The behavior of the module is represented by features in a dataset, and the intent is what we want to predict.

First, you'll need to install the required library, if not already installed:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

Here's the full Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Example data: features and labels
# Features might include metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, number of requests, etc.
# Labels are the intents, e.g., 'Idle', 'Processing', 'Error Handling'

# Sample data (usually you will load this from a database or a file)
X = np.array([
    [10, 1, 100],  # Low CPU, low memory, high requests
    [70, 30, 300], # High CPU, high memory, high requests
    [5, 10, 50],   # Low CPU, low memory, low requests
    [50, 20, 200], # Medium CPU, medium memory, medium requests
    [90, 50, 400]  # Very high CPU, high memory, very high requests
])

y = np.array([
    'Idle',
    'Processing',
    'Idle',
    'Processing',
    'Error Handling'
])

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Creating the decision tree classifier
classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Training the classifier
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Making predictions
predictions = classifier.predict(X_test)

# Evaluating the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Predicting a new sample
new_sample = np.array([[20, 5, 150]])  # New behavior data
predicted_intent = classifier.predict(new_sample)
print(f"Predicted Intent for the new sample: {predicted_intent[0]}")
```

This script does the following:
1. Imports necessary libraries.
2. Creates a sample dataset with features and labels.
3. Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Initializes and trains a decision tree classifier.
5. Makes predictions on the test set and evaluates the model's accuracy.
6. Predicts the intent of a new sample based on its behavior.

You should replace the sample data with your actual data, and you might need to adjust the features and model according to the complexity and specifics of your dataset.
