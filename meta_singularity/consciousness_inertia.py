Here's a Python script that simulates tracking resistance or momentum in internal reflection cycles, which could be interpreted in various contexts such as physics (optics), finance (stock momentum), or other systems. This example will focus on a simple model of light undergoing multiple internal reflections within a medium, calculating the intensity of light after each reflection based on the reflectivity of the medium.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def calculate_reflections(initial_intensity, reflectivity, num_reflections):
    """
    Calculate the intensity of light after multiple internal reflections.

    Parameters:
    - initial_intensity (float): The initial intensity of the light.
    - reflectivity (float): The reflectivity coefficient of the medium (0 to 1).
    - num_reflections (int): Number of reflections to simulate.

    Returns:
    - list: Intensities after each reflection.
    """
    intensities = [initial_intensity]
    current_intensity = initial_intensity

    for _ in range(num_reflections):
        current_intensity *= reflectivity
        intensities.append(current_intensity)

    return intensities

def plot_intensities(intensities):
    """
    Plot the intensities of light after each reflection.

    Parameters:
    - intensities (list): List of light intensities after each reflection.
    """
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
    plt.plot(intensities, marker='o')
    plt.title('Light Intensity After Each Internal Reflection')
    plt.xlabel('Number of Reflections')
    plt.ylabel('Intensity')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.show()

# Parameters
initial_intensity = 1.0  # Initial light intensity
reflectivity = 0.85      # Reflectivity coefficient of the medium
num_reflections = 10     # Number of reflections to simulate

# Calculate and plot
intensities = calculate_reflections(initial_intensity, reflectivity, num_reflections)
plot_intensities(intensities)
```

This script defines functions to calculate the intensity of light after each reflection and to plot these intensities. You can adjust the `initial_intensity`, `reflectivity`, and `num_reflections` to simulate different scenarios. The reflectivity should be between 0 and 1, where 1 means 100% of the light is reflected and 0 means no light is reflected.
