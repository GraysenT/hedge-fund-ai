Below is a Python script that simulates and logs the formation, decay, and reinforcement of an internal awareness attribute over time. This script uses a simple model where awareness can increase, decrease, or be reinforced based on random events.

```python
import random
import time
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='awareness_log.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

class Awareness:
    def __init__(self, initial_level=50, max_level=100, min_level=0):
        self.level = initial_level
        self.max_level = max_level
        self.min_level = min_level

    def increase(self, amount):
        if self.level + amount > self.max_level:
            self.level = self.max_level
        else:
            self.level += amount
        logging.info(f"Awareness increased to {self.level}")

    def decrease(self, amount):
        if self.level - amount < self.min_level:
            self.level = self.min_level
        else:
            self.level -= amount
        logging.info(f"Awareness decreased to {self.level}")

    def reinforce(self, factor):
        if self.level * factor > self.max_level:
            self.level = self.max_level
        else:
            self.level *= factor
        logging.info(f"Awareness reinforced to {self.level}")

def simulate_awareness():
    awareness = Awareness()
    actions = ['increase', 'decrease', 'reinforce']
    factors = [1.1, 0.9, 1.2]  # Corresponding factors for increase, decrease, reinforce

    for _ in range(100):  # Simulate 100 time steps
        action = random.choice(actions)
        if action == 'increase':
            awareness.increase(random.randint(1, 10))
        elif action == 'decrease':
            awareness.decrease(random.randint(1, 10))
        elif action == 'reinforce':
            awareness.reinforce(random.choice(factors))

        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second between actions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_awareness()
```

### Explanation:
- **Logging Setup**: The script logs all events to a file named `awareness_log.log` with timestamps.
- **Awareness Class**: Represents the internal awareness with methods to increase, decrease, and reinforce the awareness level.
- **Simulation Function**: Runs a loop where in each iteration, a random action (increase, decrease, reinforce) is chosen and applied to the awareness object. The results are logged.
- **Time Delay**: There's a 1-second delay between each action to simulate time passing.

This script can be expanded or modified to include more complex behaviors and interactions based on specific requirements.
