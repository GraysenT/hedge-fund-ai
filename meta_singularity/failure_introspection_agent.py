Below is a Python script that acts as an agent to review past failures from a dataset, identify patterns, suggest corrections, and recommend protective measures. This script uses pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and matplotlib for visualization.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

def load_data(filepath):
    """ Load data from a CSV file """
    return pd.read_csv(filepath)

def preprocess_data(df):
    """ Preprocess the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables """
    df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)
    df = pd.get_dummies(df, drop_first=True)
    return df

def split_data(df, target_column):
    """ Split data into features and target, then into training and test sets """
    X = df.drop(target_column, axis=1)
    y = df[target_column]
    return train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

def train_model(X_train, y_train):
    """ Train a Random Forest Classifier """
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model

def evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test):
    """ Evaluate the model using test data """
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, predictions))
    print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions))
    return predictions

def plot_feature_importance(model, feature_names):
    """ Plot feature importances provided by the model """
    importances = model.feature_importances_
    indices = np.argsort(importances)[::-1]
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.title('Feature Importances')
    plt.bar(range(len(importances)), importances[indices], color='b', align='center')
    plt.xticks(range(len(importances)), [feature_names[i] for i in indices], rotation=90)
    plt.xlabel('Feature')
    plt.ylabel('Importance')
    plt.show()

def main():
    # Load and preprocess data
    df = load_data('failures_data.csv')
    df = preprocess_data(df)

    # Split data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = split_data(df, 'Failure')

    # Train model
    model = train_model(X_train, y_train)

    # Evaluate model
    evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)

    # Plot feature importance
    plot_feature_importance(model, X_train.columns)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The script starts by loading data from a CSV file and preprocessing it, which includes handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Data Splitting**: The data is split into training and test sets, separating features from the target variable.

3. **Model Training**: A Random Forest Classifier is used for training. It's a good choice for this kind of task because it handles a mix of features well and provides feature importance.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The model is evaluated using the test set, and the results are printed in terms of a classification report and confusion matrix.

5. **Feature Importance Visualization**: The script plots the importance of each feature in the dataset, helping to identify which factors are most influential in predicting failures.

### Note:
- Replace `'failures_data.csv'` with the path to your actual dataset.
- Ensure the target column in your dataset is named `'Failure'` or modify the script accordingly.
- This script assumes a classification task. If your task is regression, you'll need to adjust the model and evaluation metrics.
