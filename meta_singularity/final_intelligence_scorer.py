Below is a Python script that estimates intelligence maturity based on four factors: recursion, memory, ethics, and alpha. The script defines a function that takes these four parameters as input and calculates a maturity score based on a simple weighted formula. Each factor is assumed to be a numerical value where higher values indicate higher capabilities or maturity.

```python
def estimate_intelligence_maturity(recursion, memory, ethics, alpha):
    """
    Estimates intelligence maturity based on recursion, memory, ethics, and alpha.
    
    Parameters:
    - recursion (float): Represents the ability to handle complex recursive tasks.
    - memory (float): Represents the capacity and efficiency of memory.
    - ethics (float): Represents the understanding and application of ethical principles.
    - alpha (float): Represents a general factor influencing overall cognitive abilities.
    
    Returns:
    - float: A score representing the estimated intelligence maturity.
    """
    # Weights for each component
    weight_recursion = 0.25
    weight_memory = 0.25
    weight_ethics = 0.25
    weight_alpha = 0.25
    
    # Calculate the maturity score
    maturity_score = (recursion * weight_recursion +
                      memory * weight_memory +
                      ethics * weight_ethics +
                      alpha * weight_alpha)
    
    return maturity_score

# Example usage:
recursion_score = 8.5
memory_score = 7.2
ethics_score = 9.0
alpha_score = 8.0

maturity = estimate_intelligence_maturity(recursion_score, memory_score, ethics_score, alpha_score)
print(f"Estimated Intelligence Maturity Score: {maturity:.2f}")
```

This script defines a function `estimate_intelligence_maturity` that computes a maturity score based on the provided inputs for recursion, memory, ethics, and alpha. Each factor contributes equally to the final score in this example, but you can adjust the weights according to your specific criteria or understanding of their importance.
