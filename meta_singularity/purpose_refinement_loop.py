This Python code defines a class `RecursiveRefinementSystem` that simulates the process of refining a system's purpose based on feedback from its performance and ethical evaluations. The system performs tasks and checks ethics, both simulated with random outcomes, and refines its purpose based on this feedback. The recursive refinement process is demonstrated through multiple iterations.
