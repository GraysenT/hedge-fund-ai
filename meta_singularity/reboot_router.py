Below is a Python example that demonstrates how to route execution to fallback modules or memory after a critical failure. This example uses a simple approach where the main function tries to execute a primary task, and if it fails, it will fallback to an alternative method. This is a basic simulation of handling failures and switching to a backup system.

```python
def primary_task():
    """Simulate a primary task which might fail."""
    import random
    # Simulate a failure with a 50% chance
    if random.random() < 0.5:
        raise Exception("Primary task failed.")
    return "Primary task completed successfully."

def fallback_task():
    """A fallback task to execute if the primary task fails."""
    return "Fallback task executed successfully."

def execute_with_fallback():
    """Executes the primary task with a fallback option."""
    try:
        result = primary_task()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        result = fallback_task()
    return result

# Example of using the execute_with_fallback function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = execute_with_fallback()
    print(result)
```

This code defines a `primary_task` function that randomly fails to simulate a critical failure. The `fallback_task` function acts as a backup. The `execute_with_fallback` function tries to execute the `primary_task` and catches exceptions to switch to the `fallback_task` if necessary. This simulates routing to a fallback module after a failure.
