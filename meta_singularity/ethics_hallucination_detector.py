Below is a Python code example that simulates a system where a logic loop generates ethical signals, and detects when these signals are false. This example uses a simple rule-based approach to determine the ethical validity of a signal based on predefined conditions.

```python
class EthicalSignalDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define some example rules for ethical signals
        self.rules = {
            'action': ['save', 'help', 'protect'],
            'context': ['emergency', 'danger', 'need'],
            'intention': ['good', 'beneficial', 'altruistic']
        }

    def generate_signal(self, action, context, intention):
        """
        Simulates the generation of an ethical signal based on input parameters.
        """
        return {
            'action': action,
            'context': context,
            'intention': intention
        }

    def is_ethical(self, signal):
        """
        Determines if a given signal is ethical based on predefined rules.
        """
        if (signal['action'] in self.rules['action'] and
            signal['context'] in self.rules['context'] and
            signal['intention'] in self.rules['intention']):
            return True
        return False

    def detect_false_signals(self, signals):
        """
        Detects false ethical signals from a list of signals.
        """
        false_signals = []
        for signal in signals:
            if not self.is_ethical(signal):
                false_signals.append(signal)
        return false_signals

# Example usage
detector = EthicalSignalDetector()

# Generate some signals
signals = [
    detector.generate_signal('save', 'emergency', 'good'),
    detector.generate_signal('harm', 'emergency', 'malicious'),
    detector.generate_signal('help', 'danger', 'good'),
    detector.generate_signal('ignore', 'need', 'indifferent')
]

# Detect false ethical signals
false_signals = detector.detect_false_signals(signals)

# Output the false signals
for signal in false_signals:
    print(f"False Signal Detected: {signal}")
```

This code defines a class `EthicalSignalDetector` that:
1. Initializes with a set of ethical rules.
2. Has a method to generate ethical signals based on actions, contexts, and intentions.
3. Includes a method to check if a signal is ethical.
4. Contains a method to detect and return all false ethical signals from a list.

The example usage generates a list of signals, some of which are intentionally unethical based on the defined rules, and then detects and prints these false signals. This simulation can be adapted or expanded based on more complex ethical frameworks or different application needs.
