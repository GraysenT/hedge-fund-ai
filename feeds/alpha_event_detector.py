Below is a Python script that demonstrates how to flag statistically significant signal events from a dataset using a simple statistical approach. This example assumes you have a dataset with a signal value and a noise level, and you want to flag events where the signal significantly exceeds the noise.

This script will use synthetic data for demonstration. In a real-world scenario, you would replace the synthetic data generation with actual data loading and preprocessing steps.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(0)
data_size = 1000
signal = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=data_size)  # Normal distributed signals
noise = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=0.5, size=data_size)  # Smaller noise level

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'signal': signal,
    'noise': noise
})

# Calculate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
df['SNR'] = df['signal'] / df['noise']

# Determine the threshold for significant signal
# Here we use a simple criterion: SNR > 2 is considered significant
threshold = 2

# Flag significant events
df['significant'] = df['SNR'].abs() > threshold

# Print the results
print(df.head(20))  # Display the first 20 entries
print("\nNumber of significant events:", df['significant'].sum())

# Optionally, you can also calculate the p-values assuming signal and noise are normally distributed
df['p_value'] = df.apply(lambda row: 1 - stats.norm.cdf(abs(row['SNR'])), axis=1)
df['significant_p'] = df['p_value'] < 0.05  # Using p < 0.05 as a threshold for significance

# Print results with p-values
print(df.head(20))
print("\nNumber of significant events using p-value:", df['significant_p'].sum())
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Generation**: The script starts by creating synthetic data for `signal` and `noise`. The signal is generated with a standard deviation of 1, and noise with a standard deviation of 0.5.

2. **DataFrame Creation**: A pandas DataFrame is created to hold the signal and noise data.

3. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: SNR is calculated by dividing the signal by the noise for each event.

4. **Flagging Significant Events**: Events are flagged as significant if their absolute SNR is greater than 2. This is a simple thresholding method and can be adjusted based on domain-specific knowledge.

5. **P-value Calculation**: For a more statistically rigorous approach, p-values are calculated assuming the signal and noise distributions are normal. Events are flagged based on a p-value threshold of 0.05.

This script provides a basic framework and can be expanded or modified based on specific requirements, such as different statistical tests, more complex data structures, or real-time data processing.
