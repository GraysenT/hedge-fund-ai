This Python code defines a class `SentimentShiftDetector` that can detect significant shifts in sentiment from text inputs and adjust exposure accordingly. It uses the `TextBlob` library for sentiment analysis. The `analyze_sentiment` method returns the sentiment polarity of the text, `detect_shift` checks if there's a significant shift compared to the previous sentiment, and `adjust_exposure` modifies exposure based on whether a shift was detected. Adjustments are made by either dampening or boosting the exposure based on the `dampening_factor`.
