Here is a Python code example that demonstrates how to map price or sentiment movements to known cause-effect signal paths using a simple simulation. This example will use synthetic data to illustrate the concept:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate synthetic data for prices and sentiment
np.random.seed(42)
dates = pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=100)
prices = np.random.normal(loc=100, scale=10, size=len(dates))
sentiment = np.random.normal(loc=0.5, scale=0.1, size=len(dates))

# Introduce known cause-effect
# Assume a positive news event causes a temporary rise in both price and sentiment
prices[40:50] += np.linspace(0, 20, 10)
sentiment[40:50] += np.linspace(0, 0.1, 10)

# Convert to DataFrame
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Date': dates,
    'Price': prices,
    'Sentiment': sentiment
})
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)

# Plot the data
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7))
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
plt.plot(data.index, data['Price'], label='Price')
plt.title('Price Movement')
plt.legend()

plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(data.index, data['Sentiment'], label='Sentiment', color='orange')
plt.title('Sentiment Movement')
plt.legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Analyze the correlation
correlation = data['Price'].corr(data['Sentiment'])
print(f"Correlation between price and sentiment: {correlation:.2f}")

# Detecting the effect of the known cause
effect_window = data.loc['2023-02-10':'2023-02-20']
print("Effect on Price and Sentiment during the event:")
print(effect_window[['Price', 'Sentiment']])
```

This code does the following:
1. Generates synthetic data for price and sentiment.
2. Introduces a known cause-effect scenario where a positive event causes both price and sentiment to rise temporarily.
3. Plots the price and sentiment over time to visualize the impact.
4. Calculates and prints the correlation between price and sentiment.
5. Identifies and prints the specific window where the known cause-effect is evident.

This example can be adapted to real data and more complex scenarios, including using real event data, more sophisticated statistical methods, or machine learning models to detect and predict such cause-effect relationships.
