This Python script is a basic example of how to forecast future attention focus zones based on narrative and policy cycles using machine learning techniques. It uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and a Random Forest Classifier for predicting the policy focus. The `load_data` function should be replaced with actual data loading logic, and the narrative input in `main` should be updated based on the future narrative you want to analyze.
