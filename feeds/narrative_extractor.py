Below is a Python script that demonstrates how to extract macro and micro narratives from text data and assigns them to strategy overlays. This script uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with the help of the `spaCy` library for text analysis and narrative extraction. The script also includes a simple strategy overlay assignment based on the extracted narratives.

First, ensure you have the necessary Python library installed:
```bash
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Here's the Python code:

```python
import spacy
from collections import defaultdict

# Load the English NLP model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_narratives(text):
    """
    Extracts macro and micro narratives from the given text.
    Macro narratives are identified by main topics or themes in the text.
    Micro narratives are specific events or detailed aspects within those themes.
    """
    doc = nlp(text)
    macro_narratives = defaultdict(list)
    micro_narratives = defaultdict(list)

    for sent in doc.sents:
        main_subjects = [token for token in sent if token.dep_ == 'nsubj' and token.head.pos_ == 'VERB']
        for subject in main_subjects:
            theme = subject.head.lemma_  # Using the verb lemma as a simple theme identifier
            macro_narratives[theme].append(sent.text)
            for child in subject.children:
                if child.dep_ in ['dobj', 'prep', 'acomp']:
                    micro_narratives[theme].append(child.text)

    return dict(macro_narratives), dict(micro_narratives)

def assign_strategy_overlays(narratives):
    """
    Assigns strategy overlays based on the extracted narratives.
    This is a placeholder function that assigns strategies based on simplistic rules.
    """
    strategies = {}
    for theme, details in narratives.items():
        if 'increase' in theme or 'improve' in theme:
            strategies[theme] = 'Growth Strategy'
        elif 'reduce' in theme or 'decrease' in theme:
            strategies[theme] = 'Cost Reduction Strategy'
        else:
            strategies[theme] = 'General Strategy'
    return strategies

# Example text
text = """
The company plans to increase production to meet the rising demand. 
This strategy involves improving the efficiency of the current workforce and reducing waste in the production process.
"""

# Extract narratives
macro_narratives, micro_narratives = extract_narratives(text)

# Assign strategy overlays
macro_strategies = assign_strategy_overlays(macro_narratives)
micro_strategies = assign_strategy_overlays(micro_narratives)

print("Macro Narratives:", macro_narratives)
print("Micro Narratives:", micro_narratives)
print("Macro Strategies:", macro_strategies)
print("Micro Strategies:", micro_strategies)
```

### Explanation:
- **Narrative Extraction**: The function `extract_narratives` parses the text to identify macro and micro narratives. Macro narratives are based on the main verbs and their subjects, representing broader themes or actions. Micro narratives focus on direct objects and other details linked to the main subjects, representing more specific events or aspects.
- **Strategy Assignment**: The function `assign_strategy_overlays` assigns simplistic strategic overlays based on the verb themes identified in the narratives. This is a basic example and can be expanded based on more complex rules or business logic.

This script is a basic demonstration and can be expanded with more sophisticated text analysis and strategy logic as needed.
