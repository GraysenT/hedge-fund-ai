Below is a Python code example that implements a global feed layer to re-weight strategies based on live macro themes. This example uses a simplified approach where macro themes are represented as indices or signals that can affect the weights of different strategies in a portfolio.

For this example, I'll use Python with libraries such as NumPy for numerical operations and pandas for handling data. The code will simulate receiving live macro themes, updating strategy weights accordingly, and applying these weights to a portfolio.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

class GlobalFeedLayer:
    def __init__(self, strategies, initial_weights):
        """
        Initialize the Global Feed Layer.
        
        :param strategies: List of strategy names.
        :param initial_weights: Initial weights for each strategy.
        """
        self.strategies = strategies
        self.weights = np.array(initial_weights)
        self.macro_themes = pd.DataFrame(columns=strategies)
    
    def update_macro_themes(self, new_data):
        """
        Update macro themes data.
        
        :param new_data: Dictionary with strategy names as keys and macro theme impacts as values.
        """
        new_row = pd.DataFrame(new_data, index=[pd.Timestamp.now()])
        self.macro_themes = pd.concat([self.macro_themes, new_row])
        self.adjust_weights(new_data)
    
    def adjust_weights(self, impacts):
        """
        Adjust strategy weights based on the latest macro theme impacts.
        
        :param impacts: Dictionary with strategy names as keys and macro theme impacts as values.
        """
        impact_values = np.array([impacts[strategy] for strategy in self.strategies])
        adjusted_weights = self.weights * (1 + impact_values)
        self.weights = adjusted_weights / np.sum(adjusted_weights)
    
    def get_current_weights(self):
        """
        Get the current weights of the strategies.
        
        :return: Current weights as a numpy array.
        """
        return self.weights

# Example usage
strategies = ['Strategy_A', 'Strategy_B', 'Strategy_C']
initial_weights = [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]

# Initialize the Global Feed Layer
gfl = GlobalFeedLayer(strategies, initial_weights)

# Simulate receiving new macro theme data
new_macro_data = {'Strategy_A': 0.05, 'Strategy_B': -0.02, 'Strategy_C': 0.01}
gfl.update_macro_themes(new_macro_data)

# Get updated weights
updated_weights = gfl.get_current_weights()
print("Updated Weights:", updated_weights)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The `GlobalFeedLayer` class is initialized with a list of strategies and their initial weights.
2. **Updating Macro Themes**: The `update_macro_themes` method is used to input new macro theme data. This data is expected as a dictionary where keys are strategy names and values are the impacts of the macro themes on these strategies.
3. **Adjusting Weights**: Based on the new macro theme data, the `adjust_weights` method adjusts the strategy weights. The weights are adjusted proportionally based on the impact values, and then normalized to ensure they sum to 1.
4. **Usage**: The class is used by initializing it with strategies and their weights, updating the macro themes, and then retrieving the adjusted weights.

This example can be expanded or modified to include more complex interactions between macro themes and strategies, different normalization techniques, or integration with real-time data sources.
