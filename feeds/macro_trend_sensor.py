Below is a Python script that maps high-level macroeconomic themes such as inflation or growth to specific strategy tags. The script uses a dictionary to define the mapping and provides a function to retrieve the strategy tags based on the input theme.

```python
def map_macro_themes_to_strategy(theme):
    """
    Maps high-level macroeconomic themes to strategy tags.

    Parameters:
    - theme (str): A high-level macroeconomic theme such as 'inflation' or 'growth'.

    Returns:
    - list: A list of strategy tags associated with the given theme.
    """
    theme_to_strategy = {
        'inflation': ['hedge against inflation', 'commodities', 'TIPS'],
        'growth': ['equity growth', 'emerging markets', 'technology stocks'],
        'recession': ['defensive stocks', 'government bonds', 'cash'],
        'unemployment': ['consumer staples', 'healthcare', 'utilities'],
        'interest rates': ['fixed income', 'duration management', 'floating rate bonds']
    }

    return theme_to_strategy.get(theme.lower(), [])

# Example usage:
theme_input = 'inflation'
strategy_tags = map_macro_themes_to_strategy(theme_input)
print(f"Strategy tags for {theme_input}: {strategy_tags}")
```

This script defines a function `map_macro_themes_to_strategy` that takes a macroeconomic theme as input and returns a list of related strategy tags. The mapping is stored in a dictionary where keys are themes and values are lists of strategies. The function uses the `.get()` method to safely retrieve values from the dictionary, providing an empty list as a default return value if the theme is not found. This ensures the function handles cases where an undefined theme is queried.
