Here's a Python code example that demonstrates a recursive function in a simple and understandable way. The function calculates the factorial of a number, which is a common example used to explain recursion. I've included comments to help explain the process to a non-technical person.

```python
def factorial(n):
    """
    Calculate the factorial of a number using recursion.

    A factorial of a number n (denoted as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
    For example, the factorial of 5 (5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

    Args:
    n (int): A non-negative integer whose factorial is to be calculated

    Returns:
    int: The factorial of the number n
    """
    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, the factorial is 1
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive case: multiply n by the factorial of (n-1)
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Example usage:
number = 5
result = factorial(number)
print(f"The factorial of {number} is {result}")
```

This code defines a function `factorial` that computes the factorial of a given number `n` recursively. The function calls itself with the argument decreased by one until it reaches the base case where the number is either 0 or 1. Each call to the function multiplies the number by the result of the factorial of the number one less than itself, building up the product until the base case is reached. The final result is then returned and printed.
