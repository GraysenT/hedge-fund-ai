Below is a Python code that simulates a system trajectory and evaluates which paths are sustainable based on a simple model. The model uses differential equations to represent changes in a system over time, such as population, resources, or pollution levels. We'll use the `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` method for solving these differential equations.

The example will simulate a basic ecological system where the population of a species depends on the available resources, and the resources get depleted by the population but also regenerate over time. The sustainability of a path will be determined by whether the population and resources remain within certain bounds over time.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

# Define the model
def system_model(t, y, growth_rate, consumption_rate, regeneration_rate, carrying_capacity):
    population, resources = y
    dP_dt = growth_rate * population * (1 - population / carrying_capacity) * (resources / carrying_capacity)
    dR_dt = regeneration_rate * (carrying_capacity - resources) - consumption_rate * population * resources
    return [dP_dt, dR_dt]

# Parameters
growth_rate = 0.1       # Growth rate of the population
consumption_rate = 0.02 # Rate at which the population consumes resources
regeneration_rate = 0.1 # Rate at which resources regenerate
carrying_capacity = 100 # Maximum sustainable population and resource level

# Initial conditions
initial_conditions = [
    (10, 80),  # Scenario 1: Low population, high resources
    (50, 50),  # Scenario 2: Medium population, medium resources
    (90, 10)   # Scenario 3: High population, low resources
]

# Time span
t_span = (0, 200)
t_eval = np.linspace(t_span[0], t_span[1], 400)

# Solve the system for each initial condition
results = []
for initial_condition in initial_conditions:
    result = solve_ivp(system_model, t_span, initial_condition, args=(growth_rate, consumption_rate, regeneration_rate, carrying_capacity), t_eval=t_eval)
    results.append(result)

# Plotting
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
colors = ['r', 'g', 'b']
labels = ['Low pop, high res', 'Med pop, med res', 'High pop, low res']

for result, color, label in zip(results, colors, labels):
    ax.plot(result.t, result.y[0], color=color, label=f'Population ({label})')
    ax.plot(result.t, result.y[1], color=color, linestyle='--', label=f'Resources ({label})')

ax.set_title('System Trajectories')
ax.set_xlabel('Time')
ax.set_ylabel('Population/Resources')
ax.legend()
plt.show()

# Evaluate sustainability
sustainable_thresholds = (20, 80)  # Population must stay above 20 and resources above 80 to be sustainable
sustainable_paths = []

for idx, result in enumerate(results):
    min_population = np.min(result.y[0])
    min_resources = np.min(result.y[1])
    if min_population > sustainable_thresholds[0] and min_resources > sustainable_thresholds[1]:
        sustainable_paths.append(f"Scenario {idx + 1} is sustainable.")
    else:
        sustainable_paths.append(f"Scenario {idx + 1} is not sustainable.")

for path in sustainable_paths:
    print(path)
```

This code defines a simple ecological model where the population growth is limited by the logistic model and resource availability, and resources are consumed by the population but regenerate. It simulates three different initial conditions to see how the system evolves over time and checks if the population and resources stay within sustainable thresholds. The results are plotted, and sustainability of each path is evaluated and printed.
