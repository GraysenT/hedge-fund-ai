#Below is a Python code example that dynamically adjusts the recursion depth based on the perceived complexity benefit. This example uses a simple factorial calculation to demonstrate the concept. The recursion depth is adjusted based on the size of the input number, with a higher recursion depth allowed for larger numbers, assuming that the complexity benefit (in terms of clearer and more direct code) outweighs the potential stack overflow risk for reasonable input sizes.

#This code dynamically adjusts the recursion depth based on the input size. It increases the maximum recursion depth for larger values of `n`, assuming that the factorial calculation will benefit from deeper recursion levels without hitting the system's recursion limit for reasonable sizes of `n`. The `sys.setrecursionlimit()` function is used to adjust Python's recursion limit, which is necessary to allow deeper recursion without encountering a `RecursionError`.
