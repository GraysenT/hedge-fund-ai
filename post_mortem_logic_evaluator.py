Below is a Python script that evaluates dead logic paths in a given function and identifies potential causes for these paths not being executed. The script uses the `ast` module to parse the function's abstract syntax tree (AST), analyze the control flow, and identify conditions that lead to dead paths. It then evaluates these conditions to suggest why they might not be reached.

```python
import ast
import inspect

def find_dead_paths(func):
    """
    Analyzes a function to find dead logic paths and the conditions causing them.
    """
    source = inspect.getsource(func)
    tree = ast.parse(source)
    analyzer = DeadPathAnalyzer()
    analyzer.visit(tree)

    if analyzer.dead_paths:
        print("Dead paths found:")
        for condition, reason in analyzer.dead_paths.items():
            print(f"Condition `{condition}` is always {reason}, leading to a dead path.")
    else:
        print("No dead paths found.")

class DeadPathAnalyzer(ast.NodeVisitor):
    """
    AST Node Visitor that detects dead paths in the function's logic.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.dead_paths = {}
        self.current_conditions = []

    def visit_If(self, node):
        """
        Visit If nodes and analyze conditions.
        """
        # Evaluate the condition statically if possible
        condition = ast.unparse(node.test)
        if_eval = self.static_eval(node.test)

        if if_eval is not None:
            if if_eval:
                # The else branch is dead if it exists
                if node.orelse:
                    self.dead_paths[ast.unparse(node.orelse[0])] = 'False'
            else:
                # The if branch is dead
                self.dead_paths[condition] = 'True'
        
        # Process the body of the if statement
        self.current_conditions.append(condition)
        for child in node.body:

    def static_eval(self, expr):

        """
        try:
            # Compile the expression node to a code object, then evaluate it
            compiled_expr = compile(ast.Expression(expr), '<string>', 'eval')
            return eval(compiled_expr)
        except:

# Example function to analyze
def example_function(x):
    if x > 10:
        return "Greater"
    elif x < 5:

find_dead_paths(example_function)
```

This script defines a function `find_dead_paths` that takes another function as input, parses its AST, and identifies conditions that lead to code paths that are never executed. The `DeadPathAnalyzer` class traverses the AST and checks each `if` condition to see if it can be statically determined as always `True` or `False`. If such a determination is made, the corresponding code path (either the main body or the `else` clause) is marked as dead.

You can replace `example_function` with any other function to analyze different pieces of code. Note that the static evaluation is limited and may not handle complex expressions or those involving external variables and functions.
