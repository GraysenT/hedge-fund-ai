Below is a Python code example that simulates different logical decisions using a simple scenario. The scenario involves choosing different paths based on the logic provided. The code will demonstrate how different decisions can lead to different outcomes.

```python
def decision_simulation(logic_type):
    """
    Simulate decisions based on the provided logic type.
    
    Parameters:
        logic_type (str): The type of logic to apply. Options are 'conservative', 'aggressive', or 'random'.
    
    Returns:
        str: Outcome of the decision based on the logic.
    """
    import random

    # Define possible decisions and outcomes
    decisions = {
        'conservative': 'Invest in bonds',
        'aggressive': 'Invest in stocks',
        'random': random.choice(['Invest in stocks', 'Invest in bonds', 'Invest in real estate'])
    }

    # Define possible outcomes based on decisions
    outcomes = {
        'Invest in bonds': 'Stable but lower returns',
        'Invest in stocks': 'High risk but potentially high returns',
        'Invest in real estate': 'Variable returns, depends on market conditions'
    }

    # Make a decision based on the logic type
    decision = decisions.get(logic_type, 'No valid logic provided')

    # Get the outcome based on the decision
    outcome = outcomes.get(decision, 'Unknown decision')

    return f"Decision: {decision}, Outcome: {outcome}"

# Example usage:
print(decision_simulation('conservative'))
print(decision_simulation('aggressive'))
print(decision_simulation('random'))
```

This code defines a function `decision_simulation` that takes a `logic_type` argument. It uses this argument to determine which type of investment decision to make: conservative, aggressive, or random. Each decision type is associated with a different investment strategy, and the function returns the decision along with its potential outcome. The outcomes are predefined based on typical characteristics of each investment type.
