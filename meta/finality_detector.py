Here is a Python code that implements a simple mechanism to detect when a belief, strategy, or line of thought has reached a useful conclusion. This example uses a basic feedback loop where the effectiveness of a strategy is evaluated based on predefined criteria, and the loop terminates when the criteria are met.

```python
def evaluate_strategy(strategy, goal):
    """
    Simulate the evaluation of a strategy based on a goal.
    Returns True if the strategy meets the goal, False otherwise.
    """
    # Example: Strategy effectiveness is measured as a percentage towards the goal
    effectiveness = strategy['effectiveness']
    return effectiveness >= goal

def update_strategy(strategy):
    """
    Simulate the update of a strategy.
    Increases the effectiveness of the strategy by a fixed increment.
    """
    strategy['effectiveness'] += 10
    return strategy

def has_reached_conclusion(strategy, goal):
    """
    Determines if the strategy has reached a useful conclusion.
    """
    while not evaluate_strategy(strategy, goal):
        print(f"Current effectiveness: {strategy['effectiveness']}%. Goal not reached. Updating strategy...")
        strategy = update_strategy(strategy)
    print(f"Goal reached with effectiveness: {strategy['effectiveness']}%.")
    return True

# Example usage
strategy = {'effectiveness': 20}  # Initial effectiveness of the strategy
goal = 70  # Goal effectiveness to determine the conclusion

has_reached_conclusion(strategy, goal)
```

This code defines a simple strategy evaluation and updating mechanism. The `evaluate_strategy` function checks if the strategy's effectiveness meets or exceeds a specified goal. The `update_strategy` function simulates the improvement of the strategy. The `has_reached_conclusion` function uses these to determine when the strategy has reached a useful conclusion, printing updates along the way. Adjust the initial values and increments as needed for different scenarios.
