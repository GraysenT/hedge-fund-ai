Below is a Python script that uses the `graphviz` library to create visual logic trees, demonstrating how signals flow from data to action in a simple decision-making scenario. This script assumes a basic understanding of decision trees where data is processed through various conditions to reach an action.

First, ensure you have the necessary library installed. You can install it using pip if it's not already installed:

```bash
pip install graphviz
```

Here's the Python code:

```python
from graphviz import Digraph

def create_logic_tree():
    # Create a new directed graph
    dot = Digraph()

    # Add nodes. Here, nodes represent data points, conditions, or actions.
    dot.node('A', 'Data Input')
    dot.node('B', 'Condition: Data > 50')
    dot.node('C', 'Action: Increase Value')
    dot.node('D', 'Action: Decrease Value')
    dot.node('E', 'Condition: Data < 20')
    dot.node('F', 'Action: Alert Low')
    dot.node('G', 'No Action')

    # Add edges. These represent the flow of logic from one node to another.
    dot.edge('A', 'B')
    dot.edge('B', 'C', label='True')
    dot.edge('B', 'E', label='False')
    dot.edge('E', 'F', label='True')
    dot.edge('E', 'G', label='False')

    # Render the graph to a file (PDF, PNG, etc.)
    dot.render('logic_tree', format='png', cleanup=True)
    print("Logic tree has been created and saved as 'logic_tree.png'.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_logic_tree()
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Represent steps in the decision process. This includes data inputs, conditions to evaluate the data, and actions based on those conditions.
- **Edges**: Show the flow from one step to another, with labels indicating the condition that leads to the following step.

### Output:
This script generates a PNG image named `logic_tree.png` that visually represents the logic tree. The tree starts with a data input, checks conditions, and branches into actions based on those conditions.

### Customization:
You can modify the nodes and edges to fit the specific logic of your application, including more complex conditions and multiple actions. Adjust the labels and conditions according to your needs to expand the tree's complexity.
