Below is a Python script that can be used to track the system's state, including its current traits and recent changes to its self-description. This script uses a simple file-based approach to store and update the system's state.

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime

class SystemStateTracker:
    def __init__(self, file_path='system_state.json'):
        self.file_path = file_path
        self.state = self.load_state()

    def load_state(self):
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, 'r') as file:
                return json.load(file)
        except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError):
            return {
                "traits": [],
                "self_description": "",
                "change_log": []
            }

    def save_state(self):
        with open(self.file_path, 'w') as file:
            json.dump(self.state, file, indent=4)

    def update_traits(self, new_traits):
        self.state['traits'] = new_traits
        self.log_change(f"Updated traits: {new_traits}")
        self.save_state()

    def update_self_description(self, new_description):
        self.state['self_description'] = new_description
        self.log_change(f"Updated self-description: {new_description}")
        self.save_state()

    def log_change(self, change_description):
        timestamp = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
        self.state['change_log'].append(f"{timestamp} - {change_description}")
        self.save_state()

    def get_current_state(self):
        return self.state

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    tracker = SystemStateTracker()
    tracker.update_traits(["intelligent", "responsive", "adaptive"])
    tracker.update_self_description("I am an AI designed to assist with data tracking and system state management.")
    print(tracker.get_current_state())
```

This script defines a class `SystemStateTracker` that manages the system's traits, self-description, and a log of changes. The state is stored in a JSON file, which makes it easy to view and edit outside of the program if necessary. The example usage at the bottom demonstrates how to update the system's traits and self-description and how to retrieve and print the current state.
