        # Provide feedback to all agents about the decision
        for agent in self.agents:

# Example usage
agents = [
    BeliefAgent("Belief"),
    EthicsAgent("Ethics"),

mediator = Mediator(agents)
mediator.resolve_dispute()
```

This Python code defines a simple mediator module that resolves disputes between different types of agents: Belief, Ethics, Purpose, and Alpha. Each agent provides its input based on its perspective. The mediator then resolves the dispute by prioritizing inputs based on a predefined order and communicates the decision back to all agents.
