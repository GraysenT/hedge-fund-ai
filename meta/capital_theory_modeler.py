Below is a Python code example that models capital behavior in a post-market, symbolic, or reputation-based economy. This example uses a simple agent-based model where each agent has a reputation score and trades based on that score. The model includes transactions based on reputation, and the reputation impacts the capital (or symbolic capital) of each agent.

```python
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, id, initial_reputation, initial_capital):
        self.id = id
        self.reputation = initial_reputation
        self.capital = initial_capital

    def transact(self, other):
        if self.reputation > other.reputation:
            transaction_amount = random.uniform(0, min(10, other.capital))
            self.capital += transaction_amount
            other.capital -= transaction_amount
            # Increase reputation due to successful transaction
            self.reputation += 0.1
            other.reputation -= 0.1
        else:
            transaction_amount = random.uniform(0, min(10, self.capital))
            self.capital -= transaction_amount
            other.capital += transaction_amount
            # Increase reputation due to successful transaction
            other.reputation += 0.1
            self.reputation -= 0.1

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Agent {self.id}: Reputation {self.reputation:.2f}, Capital {self.capital:.2f}"

def simulate_economy(num_agents, num_rounds):
    agents = [Agent(i, random.uniform(0, 100), random.uniform(100, 1000)) for i in range(num_agents)]
    
    for _ in range(num_rounds):
        for agent in agents:
            other_agent = random.choice([a for a in agents if a.id != agent.id])
            agent.transact(other_agent)
    
    return agents

def plot_agents(agents):
    reputations = [agent.reputation for agent in agents]
    capitals = [agent.capital for agent in agents]
    ids = [agent.id for agent in agents]

    fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()

    color = 'tab:red'
    ax1.set_xlabel('Agent ID')
    ax1.set_ylabel('Reputation', color=color)
    ax1.bar(ids, reputations, color=color)
    ax1.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color)

    ax2 = ax1.twinx()
    color = 'tab:blue'
    ax2.set_ylabel('Capital', color=color)
    ax2.plot(ids, capitals, color=color)
    ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelcolor=color)

    fig.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

# Parameters
num_agents = 10
num_rounds = 100

# Simulation
agents = simulate_economy(num_agents, num_rounds)

# Output results
for agent in agents:
    print(agent)

# Plotting results
plot_agents(agents)
```

This code defines an `Agent` class with methods for conducting transactions based on reputation. The `simulate_economy` function runs the simulation, where each agent randomly transacts with another, affecting both their capital and reputation. The `plot_agents` function plots the final reputations and capitals of the agents.

This model can be extended or modified to include more complex behaviors, different transaction rules, or additional economic factors like market conditions or external events.
