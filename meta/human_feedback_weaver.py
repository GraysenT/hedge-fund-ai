Below is a Python script that demonstrates how to ingest human feedback in the form of votes, labels, and overrides, and then use this data to adjust the logic or parameters of a system. This example will use a simple scenario where feedback is used to tune a sentiment analysis model.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

# Sample data: reviews and their sentiment labels (1 for positive, 0 for negative)
data = [
    ("Love the product", 1),
    ("Hate the product", 0),
    ("Will buy again", 1),
    ("Never buying this", 0),
    ("My favorite", 1),
    ("Worst service ever", 0),
    ("Highly recommend", 1),
    ("Not worth the money", 0),
    ("Very satisfied", 1),
    ("Completely useless", 0)
]

# Split data into texts and labels
texts, labels = zip(*data)

# Vectorize text data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

# Split data for training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a simple logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Initial accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

# Simulate human feedback
feedback = [
    (X_test[0], 1),  # Correct label provided by human for the first test sample
    (X_test[1], 0)   # Correct label provided by human for the second test sample
]

# Incorporate feedback: here we simply retrain the model including the feedback
X_feedback, y_feedback = zip(*feedback)
X_train_with_feedback = np.vstack([X_train, X_feedback])
y_train_with_feedback = np.hstack([y_train, y_feedback])

# Retrain the model with feedback
model.fit(X_train_with_feedback, y_train_with_feedback)

# Re-evaluate the model
y_pred_feedback = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy after feedback:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_feedback))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Data Preparation**: The script starts by defining a set of sample text data along with their sentiment labels. It then vectorizes the text data using `CountVectorizer` from scikit-learn, which converts text data into a format suitable for model training.

2. **Model Training**: A logistic regression model is trained on the training subset of the data.

3. **Initial Evaluation**: The model's accuracy is evaluated on a test set.

4. **Simulating Human Feedback**: Human feedback is simulated as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a sample from the test set and the correct label as determined by a human reviewer.

5. **Incorporating Feedback**: The feedback is added to the training data, and the model is retrained. This step assumes that the feedback is correct and uses it to directly adjust the model's training data.

6. **Re-evaluation**: Finally, the script re-evaluates the model on the test set to see if the accuracy has improved after incorporating the human feedback.

This script provides a basic framework that can be expanded or modified to handle more complex scenarios, different types of feedback, or more sophisticated methods of incorporating feedback into model training.
