This Python code defines a class `ThoughtProcess` that simulates a system reflecting on and mutating its own thoughts. The system generates thoughts, reflects on them, and then mutates these reflections. The example usage demonstrates how the system can cycle through these steps multiple times, showing the progression of thoughts, reflections, and mutations.
