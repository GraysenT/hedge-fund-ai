Below is a Python script that can be used to launch and monitor system background processes, ensuring they remain up and running. This script uses the `subprocess` module to manage processes and the `threading` module to continuously monitor them.

```python
import subprocess
import threading
import time

# List of commands to run each process. Update these commands as per your specific processes.
process_commands = [
    "python background_process1.py",
    "python background_process2.py",
    "node server.js",
    "ruby worker.rb"
]

# Dictionary to keep track of processes
processes = {}

def start_process(command):
    """Start a process and return the subprocess object."""
    process = subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)
    return process

def monitor_process(command):
    """Monitor a specific process and restart if it stops."""
    while True:
        if command not in processes or processes[command].poll() is not None:
            if command in processes:
                print(f"Process for command '{command}' has stopped. Restarting...")
            processes[command] = start_process(command)
        time.sleep(10)  # Check every 10 seconds

def main():
    # Start and monitor all processes
    threads = []
    for command in process_commands:
        thread = threading.Thread(target=monitor_process, args=(command,))
        thread.start()
        threads.append(thread)
    
    # Keep the main thread running
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Shutting down all processes...")
        for command in process_commands:
            if command in processes:
                processes[command].terminate()
        for thread in threads:
            thread.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Process Management**: Each command in the `process_commands` list represents a background process to be launched. These could be scripts in different languages or system commands.

2. **Monitoring**: Each process is monitored in its own thread. If a process exits (i.e., crashes or completes), it is automatically restarted.

3. **Concurrency**: The `threading` module is used to manage multiple processes concurrently. Each process has its own monitoring thread.

4. **Graceful Shutdown**: The script listens for a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) to shut down all processes gracefully.

### Usage:
- Replace the contents of `process_commands` with the actual commands you need to run as background processes.
- Ensure Python and any other required runtime (like Node.js or Ruby) are correctly installed and configured on your system.
- Run this script from a terminal or command prompt. It will keep running until manually stopped.

This script is a basic framework and might need adjustments based on specific requirements, such as more sophisticated error handling, logging, or different restart policies.
