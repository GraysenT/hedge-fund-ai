Below is a Python code example that demonstrates how to balance execution time and compute resources across agents based on their utility. This example uses a simple utility function and a priority queue to manage and distribute tasks among agents based on their efficiency and current load.

```python
import heapq
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List

@dataclass(order=True)
class Agent:
    efficiency: float  # Higher is better
    current_load: float = field(default=0, compare=False)  # Current amount of work assigned

    def add_task(self, task_load: float):
        """Add a task to this agent, increasing its load."""
        self.current_load += task_load / self.efficiency

    def __post_init__(self):
        # Adjust initial load based on efficiency for fair comparison
        self.initial_priority = self.current_load / self.efficiency

def distribute_tasks(agents: List[Agent], tasks: List[float]):
    """
    Distribute tasks among agents based on their efficiency and current load.
    
    :param agents: List of Agent objects.
    :param tasks: List of task loads.
    """
    # Create a priority queue from agents, prioritized by current load and efficiency
    heapq.heapify(agents)
    
    # Distribute tasks
    for task in tasks:
        # Pop the agent with the least load (considering efficiency)
        least_loaded_agent = heapq.heappop(agents)
        
        # Assign the task to this agent
        least_loaded_agent.add_task(task)
        
        # Push the agent back into the priority queue with updated load
        heapq.heappush(agents, least_loaded_agent)

    # Print the final distribution
    for agent in agents:
        print(f"Agent with efficiency {agent.efficiency} has load {agent.current_load}")

# Example usage
agents = [Agent(efficiency=1.5), Agent(efficiency=1.0), Agent(efficiency=2.0)]
tasks = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

distribute_tasks(agents, tasks)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Agent Class**: Represents an agent with a specific efficiency. The `add_task` method adjusts the agent's load based on its efficiency.
2. **distribute_tasks Function**: This function uses a priority queue to manage the agents. Tasks are distributed based on the agent's current load adjusted by their efficiency. The agent with the least effective load (considering efficiency) gets the next task.
3. **Priority Queue**: Python's `heapq` is used to always fetch the agent with the least load after adjusting for efficiency.

This code can be extended or modified depending on more complex utility functions or different constraints and requirements for task distribution.
