Below is a Python script that simulates a simple voting system where agents (or users) can vote on different strategies or logic to be implemented. The script includes functionalities for adding strategies, casting votes, and determining which strategy has the most votes.

```python
class VotingSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = {}
        self.votes = {}

    def add_strategy(self, strategy_id, description):
        if strategy_id not in self.strategies:
            self.strategies[strategy_id] = description
            self.votes[strategy_id] = 0
            print(f"Strategy {strategy_id} added: {description}")
        else:
            print(f"Strategy {strategy_id} already exists.")

    def vote(self, strategy_id, agent_id):
        if strategy_id in self.strategies:
            if agent_id not in self.votes:
                self.votes[strategy_id] += 1
                print(f"Agent {agent_id} voted for strategy {strategy_id}.")
            else:
                print(f"Agent {agent_id} has already voted.")
        else:
            print(f"Strategy {strategy_id} does not exist.")

    def tally_votes(self):
        if not self.votes:
            print("No votes have been cast.")
            return None
        winning_strategy = max(self.votes, key=self.votes.get)
        print(f"Winning strategy is {winning_strategy} with {self.votes[winning_strategy]} votes.")
        return winning_strategy

    def display_strategies(self):
        for strategy_id, description in self.strategies.items():
            print(f"Strategy ID: {strategy_id}, Description: {description}")

# Example usage
voting_system = VotingSystem()
voting_system.add_strategy(1, "Implement logic A")
voting_system.add_strategy(2, "Implement logic B")
voting_system.add_strategy(3, "Implement logic C")

voting_system.display_strategies()

voting_system.vote(1, "Agent1")
voting_system.vote(2, "Agent2")
voting_system.vote(1, "Agent3")
voting_system.vote(3, "Agent1")
voting_system.vote(3, "Agent2")
voting_system.vote(3, "Agent3")

voting_system.tally_votes()
```

This script defines a `VotingSystem` class with methods to add strategies, vote on them, tally votes, and display all strategies. Each strategy is identified by a unique ID and has a description. Agents are identified by unique IDs when they vote, and the system keeps track of votes for each strategy. The `tally_votes` method determines which strategy has the most votes and declares it as the winning strategy.
