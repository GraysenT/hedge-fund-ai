Below is a Python code that defines a simple framework to detect contradictions between two belief systems of agents and attempts to resolve them. The code uses a basic rule-based approach for detecting contradictions and resolving them by modifying the beliefs of the agents.

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, beliefs):
        self.name = name
        self.beliefs = beliefs  # Beliefs are stored as a dictionary

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}'s beliefs: {self.beliefs}"

def detect_contradiction(beliefs1, beliefs2):
    contradictions = {}
    for key in beliefs1:
        if key in beliefs2 and beliefs1[key] != beliefs2[key]:
            contradictions[key] = (beliefs1[key], beliefs2[key])
    return contradictions

def resolve_contradiction(agent1, agent2, contradictions):
    for key, (belief1, belief2) in contradictions.items():
        # Simple resolution strategy: compromise or choose one belief randomly
        if isinstance(belief1, bool) and isinstance(belief2, bool):
            resolved_belief = belief1 and belief2  # Logical AND as a simple resolution
        else:
            resolved_belief = belief1 if random.choice([True, False]) else belief2
        
        # Update both agents' beliefs
        agent1.beliefs[key] = resolved_belief
        agent2.beliefs[key] = resolved_belief
        print(f"Resolved {key}: {belief1} and {belief2} to {resolved_belief}")

import random

# Example agents with conflicting beliefs
agent1 = Agent("Alice", {"climate_change": True, "taxes": "high", "space_travel": "necessary"})
agent2 = Agent("Bob", {"climate_change": False, "taxes": "low", "space_travel": "unnecessary"})

# Detect contradictions
contradictions = detect_contradiction(agent1.beliefs, agent2.beliefs)
print("Contradictions detected:")
for key, (belief1, belief2) in contradictions.items():
    print(f"{key}: {belief1} vs {belief2}")

# Resolve contradictions
if contradictions:
    print("\nResolving contradictions...")
    resolve_contradiction(agent1, agent2, contradictions)

# Print final beliefs
print("\nFinal beliefs:")
print(agent1)
print(agent2)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Agent Class**: Represents an agent with a name and a set of beliefs.
2. **detect_contradiction Function**: Compares the beliefs of two agents and identifies contradictions.
3. **resolve_contradiction Function**: Resolves contradictions using a simple strategy (logical AND for boolean values or randomly choosing one of the conflicting beliefs).
4. **Example Usage**: Two agents (Alice and Bob) are defined with conflicting beliefs. The script detects these contradictions, resolves them, and prints the final beliefs of both agents.

This code can be extended with more sophisticated contradiction detection and resolution strategies depending on the complexity and nature of the beliefs involved.
