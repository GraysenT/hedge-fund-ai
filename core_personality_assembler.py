Below is a Python code example that demonstrates how to build a system's global behavioral style from agent fragments. In this context, "agent fragments" can be interpreted as pieces of behavior or rules that individual agents follow. The global behavioral style is then an emergent property that arises from the interactions of these agents.

The example uses a simple agent-based model where each agent follows simple rules, and the global behavior emerges from these interactions. We'll use the `matplotlib` library for visualization and the `numpy` library for basic numerical operations.

First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Here's the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation

# Define the Agent class
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, position, velocity):
        self.position = np.array(position)
        self.velocity = np.array(velocity)

    def update_position(self, bounds):
        """ Update the position of the agent considering the bounds of the space. """
        self.position += self.velocity
        self.position = np.mod(self.position, bounds)  # Wrap-around boundary condition

# Initialize parameters
num_agents = 50
bounds = np.array([100, 100])  # Size of the space
epochs = 50

# Create agents with random initial positions and velocities
agents = [Agent(np.random.rand(2) * bounds, np.random.rand(2) * 2 - 1) for _ in range(num_agents)]

# Function to update the system
def update(frame_num, agents, scat, bounds):
    for agent in agents:
        agent.update_position(bounds)
    scat.set_offsets([agent.position for agent in agents])
    return scat,

# Set up the figure for animation
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.set_xlim(0, bounds[0])
ax.set_ylim(0, bounds[1])
scat = ax.scatter([agent.position[0] for agent in agents], [agent.position[1] for agent in agents])

# Create animation
ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, fargs=(agents, scat, bounds), frames=epochs, interval=200, blit=True)

plt.show()
```

This code defines an `Agent` class where each agent moves in a 2D space with periodic boundary conditions. The agents' positions are updated based on their velocities, and the global behavior (e.g., clustering, dispersion) can be observed through the animation. This simple model can be expanded by adding more complex interaction rules and behaviors to study different emergent global behaviors.
