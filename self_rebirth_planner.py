Below is a Python code example that outlines a basic system for restarting an application after encountering specific critical issues such as memory loss, contradiction collapse, or ethics violations. This example uses a simple logging mechanism and exception handling to manage restarts. The system is designed to simulate the detection of these issues and to safely restart the application process.

```python
import logging
import time
import os
import sys

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

class MemoryLossException(Exception):
    pass

class ContradictionException(Exception):
    pass

class EthicsViolationException(Exception):
    pass

def check_system_integrity():
    # Simulate system checks
    import random
    issues = [MemoryLossException("Memory loss detected"), ContradictionException("Contradiction in data detected"), EthicsViolationException("Ethics violation detected")]
    if random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3]) == 1:  # Randomly choose to raise an exception or not
        raise random.choice(issues)

def main_loop():
    while True:
        try:
            # Simulate some operations
            logging.info("System is running normally.")
            check_system_integrity()
            time.sleep(2)  # Delay to simulate work

        except MemoryLossException as e:
            logging.error(f"Error: {e}")
            restart_system()

        except ContradictionException as e:
            logging.error(f"Error: {e}")
            restart_system()

        except EthicsViolationException as e:
            logging.error(f"Error: {e}")
            restart_system()

        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
            restart_system()

def restart_system():
    logging.info("Attempting to restart the system...")
    os.execv(sys.executable, ['python'] + sys.argv)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_loop()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Logging Setup**: The logging module is configured to log messages with timestamps.
2. **Custom Exceptions**: Three custom exceptions (`MemoryLossException`, `ContradictionException`, `EthicsViolationException`) represent the specific issues the system might encounter.
3. **System Integrity Check**: The `check_system_integrity` function randomly simulates the occurrence of one of the predefined issues.
4. **Main Loop**: The `main_loop` function continuously runs and checks for system integrity. If an issue is detected, it is logged, and the system attempts to restart.
5. **Restart Mechanism**: The `restart_system` function uses `os.execv` to restart the application. This function replaces the current process with a new one, effectively restarting the application.

This code provides a basic framework and can be expanded with more sophisticated monitoring and recovery strategies depending on the specific requirements and environment.
