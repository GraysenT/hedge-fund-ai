Here's a Python script that generates code, sends it to the OpenAI API for review, and then parses the response for safety, quality, and improvement suggestions before deploying the logic. This example assumes you have an API key for OpenAI and uses the `requests` library to interact with the API.

```python
import requests
import json

def generate_code(prompt):
    """ Generate code using OpenAI's Codex """
    url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    data = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "max_tokens": 150,
        "temperature": 0.5,
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()

def review_code(code):
    """ Send code back to OpenAI for safety and quality review """
    review_prompt = f"### Review the following Python code for safety, quality, and improvement suggestions:\n{code}"
    url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    data = {
        "prompt": review_prompt,
        "max_tokens": 250,
        "temperature": 0.5,
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.json()

def deploy_logic(code):
    """ Logic to deploy the code, can be customized based on your deployment process """
    print("Deploying the following code:")
    print(code)

def main():
    # Example prompt to generate code
    prompt = "Write a Python function to calculate factorial of a number using recursion."
    generated_code_response = generate_code(prompt)

    # Extract the generated code
    generated_code = generated_code_response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()

    # Review the generated code
    review_response = review_code(generated_code)
    review_text = review_response['choices'][0]['text'].strip()

    # Print the review and decide whether to deploy
    print("Review of the generated code:")
    print(review_text)

    # Example condition to check review before deploying
    if "no issues" in review_text.lower():
        deploy_logic(generated_code)
    else:
        print("Code deployment halted due to issues found during the review.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Notes:
1. Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API key.
2. The `generate_code` function sends a prompt to the Codex model to generate code.
3. The `review_code` function sends the generated code back to the Codex model for a review, asking specifically for safety, quality, and improvement suggestions.
4. The `deploy_logic` function is a placeholder where you would integrate your actual code deployment process.
5. The script checks if the review contains "no issues" before deploying. Adjust this logic based on the actual responses and your criteria for deployment.
