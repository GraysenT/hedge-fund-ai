Here's a Python example that demonstrates a simple agent system where agents can self-reflect and adapt their logic between cycles based on their previous experiences. This example uses a basic agent framework where each agent can evaluate its performance and adjust its strategy accordingly.

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.score = 0
        self.strategy = "cooperate"

    def decide(self):
        return self.strategy

    def reflect_and_adapt(self, success):
        if success:
            # If successful, continue with the same strategy
            self.score += 1
        else:
            # If not successful, change strategy
            if self.strategy == "cooperate":
                self.strategy = "defect"
            else:
                self.strategy = "cooperate"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}: {self.strategy} (Score: {self.score})"

def interaction(agent1, agent2):
    decision1 = agent1.decide()
    decision2 = agent2.decide()
    if decision1 == "cooperate" and decision2 == "cooperate":
        agent1.reflect_and_adapt(True)
        agent2.reflect_and_adapt(True)
    elif decision1 == "defect" or decision2 == "defect":
        if decision1 == "defect" and decision2 == "cooperate":
            agent1.reflect_and_adapt(True)
            agent2.reflect_and_adapt(False)
        elif decision1 == "cooperate" and decision2 == "defect":
            agent1.reflect_and_adapt(False)
            agent2.reflect_and_adapt(True)
        else:
            agent1.reflect_and_adapt(False)
            agent2.reflect_and_adapt(False)

def main():
    agent1 = Agent("Agent 1")
    agent2 = Agent("Agent 2")

    for _ in range(10):  # Run 10 cycles
        interaction(agent1, agent2)
        print(agent1)
        print(agent2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script defines an `Agent` class where each agent has a name, a score, and a strategy (either "cooperate" or "defect"). The `decide` method returns the current strategy of the agent. The `reflect_and_adapt` method allows the agent to change its strategy based on whether the previous interaction was successful.

The `interaction` function defines how two agents interact and how their decisions affect their scores and strategies. The main function creates two agents and runs several cycles of interactions, allowing the agents to adapt their strategies based on the outcomes of their interactions.
